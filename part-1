1.Definition and Importance of Version Control Systems (VCS)

Q.Explain what a VCS is.
ANS.A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that helps manage changes to source code over time by keeping track of modifications, enabling collaboration, and maintaining a history of revisions.

Q.Discuss why VCS is essential in software development.
ANS.A VCS is essential in software development because it facilitates collaboration, maintains a comprehensive history of changes, and enables efficient tracking, merging, and rollback of code.

2.Introduction to Git

Q.Describe what Git is and its main features.
ANS.Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development, featuring branching and merging, distributed repositories, and efficient handling of large projects.

Q.Compare Git with other version control systems (e.g., Subversion, Mercurial).
ANS.Git, Subversion (SVN), and Mercurial are version control systems:

1.Git: Distributed, fast, flexible branching/merging, steeper learning curve, most popular.
2.SVN: Centralized, easier to learn, slower branching/merging, still used in enterprises.
3.Mercurial: Distributed, user-friendly, good performance, smaller community than Git.
