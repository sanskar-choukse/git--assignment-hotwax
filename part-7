Q.Explain the concept of branches in Git.

Q.How to create, list, and switch branches.
ANS:To create a branch: `git branch branch_name`, to list branches: `git branch`, to switch branches: `git checkout branch_name`.

Q.Assignment: Create a new branch, switch to it, and make some commits.
ANS:Create a new branch: `git branch new_branch_name`, switch to it: `git checkout new_branch_name`, make commits: edit files and use `git add` and `git commit`.
